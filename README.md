## Features

- **Welcome Message**  
  Aetheria kicks off every interaction with a warm welcome:  
  *"Hi, I'm Aetheriaâ€”your personal AI assistant. I'm here to help with your studies, research, or anything around campus. How can I assist you today?"*

  - **Experiential Learning:** Get details on internships, co-ops, and research opportunities.

- **Dynamic Follow-up Questions**  
  After every query, Aetheria asks:  
  *"Do you have any other questions?"*  
  This keeps the conversation going and ensures all user concerns are addressed.

- **Campus Tour Booking**  
  Aetheria helps users schedule a campus tour by collecting their name, email, and preferred visit date. The details are confirmed with the user, and a confirmation message is sent.
